She chooses one of two options, each of which requires a DC 30 Fortitude save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n     • <b>Drain Blood</b> Lady Nightshade drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is drained 1 and she regains 5 HP (or, on a critical failure, it's drained 2 and she regains 10 HP).\n     • <b>Drain Vitality</b> (necromancy) Lady Nightshade draws out some of the creature's vital essence.
