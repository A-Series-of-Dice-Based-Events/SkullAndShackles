Each non-harpy creature within a 300-foot aura must attempt a DC 25 Will save to avoid becoming captivated by the harpy’s song. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the harpy uses this ability again on subsequent rounds, it extends the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Captivating Song, that creature is temporarily immune to Captivating Songs for 24 hours.\nSuccess The creature is unaffected.\nFailure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to the harpy as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated creature is adjacent to the harpy, it stays still and doesn’t act. If attacked by the harpy, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the harpy’s turn.\nCritical Failure As failure, but if attacked by the harpy, the creature can attempt a new save at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the harpy’s turn."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"ce","size":"large","type":"fiend","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"morningstar","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"+1 status to all saves vs. magic","creature":"","speed":"20 feet, fly 60 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"3","benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"low","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-1","benchmark":"low","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"2","benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"17","benchmark":"high","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"17","benchmark":"high","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"17","benchmark":"high","note":"+19 singing"},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"25","benchmark":"high","note":""},"hp":{"value":"108","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"13","benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"17","benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"fire 5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"good 5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"converted by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_10qmhagtupr","name":"morningstar","traits":"versatile P","attack":"+15 [+10/+5]","damage":"2d6+6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 evil and 1d6 fire","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_1babkngxc95","name":"talon","traits":"agile, finesse","attack":"+16 [+12/+8]","damage":"2d6+6 slashing","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Common"}
