Their understandings of magic and science had grown by leaps and bounds past the others, and they were refused to share their progress with others. Instead, they protected and hoarded their knowledge meticulously, maybe fearing that if others got a\nhold of their same knowledge, that it would be the end of their society. That they would have their learning turned against them.\n\nUnfortunately for them, despite all their planning and preparations, devastation still struck. No one is sure of what or where their downfall came from, but in the span of a few days, the society was lost to the world. Their buildings were destroyed, their cities leveled, their knowledge lost to the waves and fire that wiped away almost all proof of their existence. What did survive in their place are the horrifying beasts and machines they built to protect their now ruined cities. One such machine is the plated guardian, a massive mechanical crustacean that had been created to become a powerful protector of ancient sites.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"15 feet, swim 50 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":11,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":1,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"constitution":{"value":9,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":-4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":0,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":-5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":28,"benchmark":"low","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":36,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":28,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":41,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":340,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":36,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":28,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"will":{"value":27,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"physical 15 (except adamantine)","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poisoned, sickened, unconscious","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Created by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_8sjmz62za4","name":"claw","traits":"agile, deadly 3d12, magical, reach 15 feet","attack":"+36 [+32/+28]","damage":"4d8+17 bludgeoning plus improved grab","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_2jmknxly9pg","name":"tail","traits":"deadly 3d12, magical, reach 15 feet","attack":"+36 [+31/+26]","damage":"4d12+17 bludgeoning","type":"Melee"}]}
