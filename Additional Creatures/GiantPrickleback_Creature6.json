The prickleback then rises 40 feet towards the surface of the water every round until it reaches the surface.

It is covered in spikes and is rather sluggish despite how aggressive it is to others. It has been known to eat humanoids, though it'll eat anything that is smaller than it is. Most people find these creatures to be more trouble than they are worth and avoid them as much as possible. \n\nThese fish, when faced with mortal peril, will suddenly inflate themselves, shooting themselves toward the surface. This expanded size makes them far harder to eat, as their spikes are protruding even further from their bodies, and most predators will leave them alone, looking for a less painful meal. If a prickleback has inflated itself, they can easily be spotted from above the water as their large bulk bobs halfway out of the water. Sailors will avoid these bobbing pricklebacks, thinking they are a bad omen.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"swim 25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"low","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"high","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"3","benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"0","benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":"11","benchmark":"low","note":"low-light vision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"12","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"22","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"119","benchmark":"high","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"17","benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"12","benchmark":"low","note":""},"will":{"value":"13","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"Created by VaranSL","strikes":[{"id":"_2j2scvbce2i","name":"bite","traits":"agile","attack":"+17 [+13/+9]","damage":"2d6+9 piercing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_vcxkmfufs0","name":"spike","traits":"range 20 feet","attack":"+17 [+12/+7]","damage":"2d4+9 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed","type":"Ranged"}]}
